# Syntecxhub_project3_titanic_dataset_EDA
A data analysis  project exploring survival factors in the Titanic  through data visualization and statistical insights . exploratory data analysis on the titanic dataset to uncover survival insights using python,pandas,mataplotlib,and seaborn.
Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to analyze factors that influenced passenger survival.
The goal is to discover meaningful insights using data visualization and statistical analysis.
-> Objective
To analyze passenger survival patterns based on:
1.Gender
2.Age
3.Passenger Class
4.Survival Status
->Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Google Colab
-> Key Analysis Performed
Survival count visualization
Survival by Gender
Survival by Passenger Class
Age distribution analysis
->Key Insights
Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males.
1st class passengers had better survival chances.
Younger passengers showed slightly higher survival probability.
Fare price had some influence on survival likelihood.
->dataset
Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset (commonly available on Kaggle and Seaborn library).
Target Variable:
Survived (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)
